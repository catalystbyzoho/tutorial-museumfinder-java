# Museum Finder - Circuits - Java

This is a museum finder application that lists museums in the USA, based on certain criteria that the users choose.

The application fetches information from public datasets hosted by Catalyst that contain records of ratings and traveller type suitability of museums from various websites. The application processes these in parallel and emails the results to the user.

The application's workflow is automated using a Catalyst Circuit, which orchestrates and executes each task to be carried out automatically.
